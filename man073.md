The Inventory Items (I) screen is used to store data concerning the products you have to sell. Also stored here are non-salable items, such as freight costs, tax rates, or labor codes.    
  
A wide variety of information about the items you sell is stored here. So take some time to become familiar with such things as Discount Setup, Unit Codes, Activity Locations, Tracking Serial Numbers, and much more.    
  
Also some exciting new features have been added in this latest version of our accounting software. Learn about the possibilities of showing pictures, blue prints, and other documentation for your inventory items.

Figures are entered as positive or negative: i.e. 100+50-75= would be entered as 100+; 50+; 75- The answer calculates each time you press the positive or negative sign. The = sign or Enter key seldom need be used unless you are multiplying or dividing.    
  
**Shift+Down** arrow-moves cursor to Track Serial # field, last field on screen.       
  
#### Reports Help (I)     
  
**NOTE:** The onscreen reports are shown in reverse. For example, **Alt+B** lists inventory purchases starting with the most recent bill and ending with the oldest bill.     
  
(The **F11** hot key takes you straight to the Report Menu. Then you can just press the letter of the report you wish to run. Of course, using your mouse works too.)    
  
**O**-**Standard Screen**-displays the standard Inventory Items screen view without the picture window.    
  
**M**-**Picture Screen**-displays a picture window where you can insert one or more pictures of this item. Open the folder on your computer where this picture is stored. Drag the file to this window, and drop it there in the window. The picture opens up and is displayed here. If you want multiple pictures for this item, drag and drop each picture here. When you drop more than one picture here, you will be asked if you are overwriting the previous picture, or if you want to store multiple pictures here. Choose No if you want to store multiple pictures. When you click on the picture window, the picture is opened up in your picture viewing program along with all the other pictures you have chosen for inventory items. Each picture is named after the item code, with additional numbers appended when you have multiple pictures for one item. Notice that this M report option is the first of 2. To activate it, you will need to either click on it or press Enter when this option is highlighted with F11,M.    
  
**A**-**All Serial Numbers**-displays all serial numbers for the currently loaded item, showing which are on hand and which are sold. (Runs from Report 1-17.)

**I**-**Inventory Adjustments**-displays inventory adjustments that were made on the Inventory Stock Adjustments (=) screen for the currently loaded inventory item.     
  
Note that any documentation referring to the Job Costing Module (Material, Job, or Job Detail screens) does not apply to most users. It is a custom feature.    
  
**L**-**Label**-sends the information to create a label for this item to your label printer.    
  
**B**-**Bin Label**-sends the information to create a label for a bin of these items to your label printer.    
  
**M**-**Material Detail**-*ABC JOB COSTING MODULE*-displays Material detail from the Job Materials Entry screen for the currently loaded item. Options: **U** for **U**nbilled, **T** for Billed **T**ime & Material or **C** for Billed **C**ontract. (This runs from Report 1-22.)

#### Inventory Item No. (I.0)     
  
Enter the code you will use to reference this item. Observe the following rules when creating record codes.    
  
1. Item numbers ending with a period (.) are not allowed because they are reserved to indicate a remark on the Receivable Invoice (R) screen and the Bill Entry (B) screen.    
  
2. Do not use a forward slash (/) in your Item code if you will be tracking serial numbers on this item.    
  
3. Note: Item codes ending with &, $ or * should be used for setting up rebate items. (See section titled "[Tracking Inventory Rebates](#BKMKITracking).")    
  
4. If a digitizer is used for entering items, item codes beginning with a one (1) may not be used. (A digitizer is a pad with an electronic pen).     
  
Some items may have been pre-entered for your convenience, for example:     
  
D for Discount  
  
PA for Sales Tax (A/R)  
  
F for Freight  
  
PB for Prior Balance   
  
T for Sales Tax  
  
FC for Finance Charge     
  
#### Alternate Item Numbers    
  
You can enter or look up alternate item numbers for an inventory item by clicking the **Alternate** link after the item number. Multiple levels will work. If item A references item B which references item C, any of the 3 will show all 3 in the lookup. On a customer order or invoice, an **AltItems** link will appear on the bottom line if a selected item has alternate parts.    
  
#### Picture    
  
This link displays a large picture window for the item. You can insert pictures here or in the small window on the standard Items screen. Open the folder on your computer where this picture is stored. Drag the file to this window, and drop it there in the window. The picture opens up and is displayed here. If you want multiple pictures for this item, drag and drop each picture here. When you drop more than one picture here, you will be asked if you are overwriting the previous picture, or if you want to store multiple pictures here. Choose No if you want to store multiple pictures. When you click on the picture window, the picture is opened up in your picture viewing program along with all the other pictures you have chosen for inventory items. Each picture is named after the item code, with additional numbers appended when you have multiple pictures for one item.    
  
#### Description Field (I.1)     
  
Type the description as it should appear on the Receivable Invoice.     
  
If you have many inventory items to enter, you could save time by using computer generated descriptions as described below.    
  
#### Computer Generated Descriptions (I)     
  
When you are entering a new item, the program can automatically generate the description, based on the characters in the Item #. Here is a brief summary of the setup.    
  
1. Make a default record with a quote (") plus a character for the Item #. (Like "E for a series of Eversharp Ballpoint Pens.) Enter a basic description (such as Eversharp). Enter a capital letter in the Remark field (such as B). Press **F9** to save.     
  
2. Make another record which will link your default record to the automatically generated records. In the Item # field, place a # sign, the letter you entered in the Default record's Remark field, and further identifying letters (such as #BBP-the BP on the end standing for Ballpoint Pens.) Enter more description. (For instance, enter Ballpoint Pens in the Description field.) In the Remark field, enter a command number or symbol (like _2) from the choices given on the following pages. Press **F9**.     
  
3. On a new record, Enter the letter you used in your default record (like E), the final letters you used in your linking record (like BP), and further descriptive characters (like 20).     
  
Using the example we have been following, you would enter EBP20 in the Item # field. You will be asked you if you want 20 Eversharp Ballpoint Pens as your description, which is, of course, exactly what we wanted. In the same way EBP50 as the Item # would generate a description of 50 Eversharp Ballpoint Pens.    
  
See further examples after the explanations on the use of Remark commands.    
  
#### Descriptions of Generator Commands (I)    
  
**0**-The commands following zero are optional.   
  
**1**-The one number entered in the item # will be printed as a one-digit number in the description.   
  
**2**-The two numbers entered in the item # will be printed as a two-digit number in the description.   
  
**3**-The three numbers entered in the item # will be printed as a three-digit number in the description.   
  
**8**-The two numbers entered in the item # will be printed as a one-digit whole number and a fraction with a denominator of 8. For a denominator of 16, in the item # enter * and the number of sixteenths needed. Example: *5 in the item #, would be 5/16 in the item description. These are used for various sizes of lumber, pipe fittings, etc.   
  
**$**-A 3-digit number in the item # will be printed as money in the description. Example: 155 in the item # makes 1.55 in the description.   
  
*****-A one-digit number in the item # will be followed by a zero when printed in the description.   
  
**_**-An underline before another command makes a space in the description.   
  
**<**-A description preceded by a < will be placed to the left in the item description.     
  
#### Description Generator Examples (I)     
  
Let's say you sell Eversharp Ballpoint Pens by the pack, various quantities per pack.       First set up a default record.    
  
1. Enter E as the item #.   
  
2. Enter Eversharp for description. (This indicates the item #s will start with E and the item description with Eversharp.)   
  
3. Enter B in the Remark field. (The B is what alerts the software that there are linking items beginning with #B.)  
  
4. Save with **F9**.       Next set up the linking record.      Enter #BBP as the item #.    Enter Ballpoint Pens as the description.       (The first character after the # will not be part of the final item #. It       is only the link between the default record and the # record. So, it must       match the one entered in Remark on the default record.)    Enter the commands _2 in the Remark field. (This       indicates that the 2 digits attached to the item # should be printed as a       2-digit number followed by a space in the item description.)   Save with **F9**.    Result: EBP20 as the Item # generates 20       Eversharp Ballpoint Pens as the description. And EBP50 as the Item #       generates 50 Eversharp Ballpoint Pens as the description.          Try this variation:          Change the _2 in your #BBP record to C.    Save.    Make a record that links with your linking       record by entering #CGN as the item #, Green as description and _2 as       Remark.    Save.    Result: EBPGN40 as the Item # generates 40       Eversharp Ballpoint Pens Green as the description.          Try this:           Enter #CRD as the Item #, Red as the       Description and _2 as the Remark.    Save.    Result: EBPRD12 as the Item # generates 12       Eversharp Ballpoint Pens Red as the description.        
  
Note that the commands you use in the Remark field must be on the last sequential linking (#) record. You can enter multiple commands in the Remark field of the last # record. The commands 1, 2, or 3 are carried out and the results separated by an x.       Try this:           Item #-"P   Description-Plywood   Remark-C   Save   Item #-#CCD   Description-Cedar Sheets   Remark- _23   Save   Result: PCD12400 as item # generates 12x400       plywood cedar sheets as the description.       
  
(Using both the 2 and 3 commands in the remark field required us to use 5 digits at the end of the item number with the x coming between the first 2 and last 3 digits.)       If we have 203 in remark, we must have either      a 2 or 5-digit number in item #. (The 0 indicates that the command      following is optional; we may or may not use it.)           Item #-#CCD   Description-Cedar Sheets   Remark-_203 on the #CCD linking record.    Result 1: PCD12 as item # generates 12       Plywood Cedar Sheets as the description.   Result 2: PCD24120 in Item # generates 12       Plywood Cedar Sheets as the description.        
  
To eliminate the default description from the item description, place an asterisk (*) at the beginning of the description on your # record. (*Cedar Sheets would generate a description without Plywood in it.)   
  
Placing a < at the beginning of the # description, moves it to the left in the final item description.       Try this:      Item #- "OB   Description-Oil Burner   Remark-B   Save.    Item #-#BNA   Description-*A Burner Nozzle   Remark- _$*   Save   Result: Item #-OBNA1234 generates the       description - 1.23x40 A Burner Nozzle.        
  
(Notice the use of *s in this example. The * before the description eliminated the use of the description "Oil Burner" from the default record. The use of the command * with the command $ adds a zero to the 4.)       Try this: (using items set up in earlier      examples)           Item #-#CY   Description-Yellow   Remark-_*    Item #-EBPY3   Result: Description-30 Eversharp Ballpoint       Pens Yellow          Try this:          On the #CY record, change description to       <yellow. (The < moves yellow to the left in the final description).   Item # as EBPY2    Result: Description-20 Yellow Eversharp       Ballpoint Pens is generated.          Let's do a new one.           Item #-"BL,   Description-Bolt   Remark-C   Save   Item #-#CCR   Description-<"Carriage   Remark-82   Save   Result 1: Item #-BLCR0204 generates a       description of 1/4x4" Carriage Bolt.    Result 2: Item #-BLCR0606 generates       3/4x6" Carriage Bolt.   Result 3: Item #-BLCR0505 generates       5/8x5" Carriage Bolt.   Result 4: Item #-BLCR2303 generates 2       3/8x3" Carriage Bolt. (Note the whole number along with the       fraction.)   Result 5: Item #-BLCR*703 generates       7/16x3" Carriage Bolt. (Notice what the * did here.)              
  
#### Sale #### G/L (I.2)     
  
Enter the G/L account number of the sales category for this item. When this item is entered on a receivable invoice, the Sale G/L # will automatically carry across. When the item is entered on a bill, the Purchase G/L # will automatically fill in. The Purchase G/L # is computed by taking the Sale G/L # and adding the Accounts Payable G/L Adder as found on the Company Setup (#) screen.     
  
Our standard G/L account number for Sales is 5000, and the Accounts Payable G/L Adder (on the # screen) is 2000.     
  
The Sale G/L # is also used by Report # 1-7, INVENTORY VALUE, when posting to General Ledger.     
  
Inventory can be sorted by this field, using Report # 1-1, INVENTORY LISTING. Select G to sort by G/L #.     
  
#### Tax (I.3)     
  
A "ditto dat" field. A lookup appears for this field, revealing a list of all codes you have entered in this field in the past.    
  
If this item is not normally taxable, enter **E** for **E**xempt. If this field is left blank, sales tax is calculated automatically on this item.     
  
An **X** in this field specifies that this record is a Sales Tax record.     
  
An **S** (**S**ometimes) may be entered to calculate tax on this item manually. Using an S also gives you the option to indicate on the Customer screen, in the Tax Code # field, whether a customer always pays tax on this item, usually pays tax on this item, or is usually exempt from tax. (T or E will be the defaults when the item is entered on a Receivable Invoice. [Do not enter the A, T or E here.])    
  
#### Multiple Tax Codes (I.3)     
  
If you have more than one sales tax that applies to items that you sell, you can set them up by using the following steps.     
  
1. Set up a Tax Code in the Inventory screen, using a % in the Unit field, the rate of tax in the List Price and an X in the Tax field. (This is the same as a single tax rate.) For more information, see [Sales Tax Setup & Usage](../../../../../Users/Lanita/Documents/manual/trunk/man082.htm#Rs).    
  
2. Any group of items which is ALWAYS exempt from this tax, is identified with a single character in the Buy Description field. This character can be anything except *,E,M,S,T,U and X.     
  
3. Any group of items which is SOMETIMES exempt from this tax is identified with a single character in the P/O Message field. Again, this character can be anything except *,E,M,S,T,U and X.     
  
4. Inventory items are put in a tax group by placing a character in the Tax field on the Inventory screen of the inventory item. Use any character except*,E,M,S,T,U and X.     
  
#### Tax Setup for Selling to Farmers (I.3)    
  
1. Place a character in the Tax field of the inventory item to designate the item as production or non-production. A third category for items that can be either would trigger a question each time they are sold. On default (") item and any prefix defaults, enter the appropriate default in the Tax field. Use any character except *,E,M,S,T,U and X.    
  
2. Set up a special [tax item](../../man082.htm#Rs) (.PF) for farmers. In Buy Description, enter the tax category(ies) for production items that are always exempt for farmers. In P/O Message, enter the tax category(ies) for items that are sometimes taxable for farmers.    
  
3. On the customer, work order, and invoice, use tax code .PF for farmers. Use .PA for other taxable customers. Use .PA/ for exempt customers, such as resellers.    
  
#### Tax Setup for States with Multiple Rates (I.3)    
  
1. On each item, enter a code in the Tax field to select the rate category (food, non-food, restaurant). Set default items as needed.    
  
2. Set up a [tax item](../../man082.htm#Rs) for each rate category. In Buy Description enter the categories for the items that are not taxed at this rate. For example, the non-food code would list the food and restaurant categories as exempt.    
  
3. On the customer, work order, and invoice, enter all the tax codes for every taxable customer. Example: .VA,.VF,.VR    
  
#### Unit (I.4)     
  
A "ditto dat" field. A lookup appears for this field, revealing a list of all codes you have entered in this field in the past.    
  
The Unit determines how the list price is figured. You may use any 2 or 3 letter code such as: yd, in, ton, bu, ft, lb.     
  
**Unit Pricing**    
  
Following is a list of special codes and an explanation of their functions:     
  
**C**-Priced per 100     
  
**M**-Priced per 1000     
  
**G**-Priced per 100 gallon    
  
**T**-Priced per ton   
  
(You may also combine a number and a letter. For example, 5C means priced per 500. You may also use a number only, such as 3. )    
  
**D**-Used for egg pricing. Enter the number of dozen per case, followed by D. Enter list price per dozen in cents, not dollars. Sell quantity is number of cases.     
  
**O**-Priced per ton and doesn't print this line on invoices or orders but includes the amount in the invoice total.     
  
#-For items priced per each but stocked and sold by case, enter the case quantity followed by a #. Cost is then cost per case.     
  
**S, SF** and **SY** work similarly to # for pricing.    
  
**+** (plus sign)-Used to add a flat charge over and above the sell price. The "+" must be the leftmost character in the unit. Example: Quantity: 2 Unit: +5.5 Sell Price: 3.00 Amount: 11.50 (2 x 3 + 5.5) Note that the charge is added to the extended amount, not the price each. If the quantity is negative, the charge will be deducted. If the quantity is 0, the charge has no effect.    
  
**-** (minus sign)-If the minus sign is used between 2 numbers in the unit field, the numbers are recognized as inches and multiplied times each other, calculating square footage. For example, with 2 as quantity, 24-24 in Unit field and a price of 4.50, the total would be $36.00 because 24" x 24" is 4 sq. ft. and 2 (quantity) x 4 (sq. ft.) x 4.50 (price) =36.     
  
**F**-Specify this item as freight or other adjustment. Now this item will not be included for other discounts given on an invoice.    
  
**&**-Means mix and match discounts, &A means that this item will be totaled with any other &A item on the invoice for a discount based on quantity. Other letters or numbers may be used in place of the A, such as &1 or &D. Discounts calculate when the invoice is saved.     
  
**>**-indicates a Major Component with Service Tracking. You must also have a Y in the Track Serial # field on the I screen. (See the helps for Report # 1-34, SERIAL NUMBER SALES AND SERVICE DETAIL.)     
  
**S0-S9**-*ABC SCHEDULING MODULE*-Identifies schedule item. May be followed by # of working days allowed in schedule.     
  
**Unit Assemblies (R)**    
  
**B**-indicates an Assembly. Each item is listed on the invoice with its price. Total price is determined by the totals of the items.     
  
**BK**-indicates an Assembly. The price is manually set on the I screen. Prices for items are not listed on the invoice.     
  
**BN**-indicates Assembly. Price set manually. Items are not listed on Invoice.     
  
**BL**-Displays a lookup for entry of associated Items when entered on the R screen. A W screen record with a }Item# code defines the display.     
  
#### BP/P-indicates an Assembly package price, allowing you to set a price independent of the item prices. Items and prices show on invoice. Total price is also displayed. An additional item is required for this to work. After creating your Assembly item with the BP in the Unit field, create a second item with a T at the end of the Item #. In the Unit field of this one, put a P.        
  
**Unit-A*BC JOB COSTING MODULE* (R)**     
  
**L1, L2, L3**-These codes are used with Estimating and Job Costing. They specify whether Quantity on this line is posted to the Hours 1, Hours 2, or Hours 3 field on the Job Detail ('D) screen. Cost Extension (Cost x Quantity = Cost Extension) posts to the Labor Cost field. This is calculated but not shown on the screen. You can look at or change this by pressing **Alt+=**. If these codes are used on an Estimate Order, this line posts into Estimated in the Labor Cost and Hours fields. If this is an invoice, Quantity and Amount posts into the other Labor Cost and Hours fields. NOTE: This will NOT work if this invoice is a Contract.     
  
**K**-Post this line into Subcontract on the Job Detail ('D) screen. If this is used on an Estimate Order it posts into Estimated. If it is used on an Invoice it posts into the other Subcontract fields. NOTE: This will NOT work if this invoice is a Contract.     
  
**X**-Post cost for this line from the Assembly (A) screen to the Estimated Material Cost field on Job Detail ('D) screen. This only works with an Estimate Order.     
  
**:**-This is used by Report #s 5-30 and 5-31.   
  
Note that any documentation referring to the Job Costing Module (Material, Job, or Job Detail screens) does not apply to most users. It is a custom feature.    
  
#### Multiplier (I.5)     
  
A "ditto dat" field. A lookup appears for this field, revealing a list of all codes you have entered in this field in the past.    
  
When you enter a Multiplier here, Report # 2-10, INVENTORY PRICE UPDATE, automatically updates the List Price. You can also use the figure in the Multiplier field to calculate the Cost with **Alt+K** or List with **Alt+L** on the Inventory (I) screen. Either way, enter the percentage of List Price that the Cost should be.     
  
If you use a discount from List Price, subtract the discount percent from 100 to get the Multiplier. For example, if the discount is 30%, the Multiplier is 70.     
  
If you are working with a markup over Cost, you can use the following table to find the Multiplier. For example, if the markup is 25%, the Multiplier is 80.     
  
1%=99.01                    19%=84.03                  37%=72.99                  75%=57.14   
  
2%=98.04                    20%=83.33                  38%=72.46                  80%=55.56   
  
3%=97.09                    21%=82.64                  39%=71.94                  85%=54.05   
  
4%=96.15                    22%=81.97                  40%=71.43                  90%=52.63   
  
5%=95.24                    23%=81.30                  41%=70.92                  95%=51.28   
  
6%=94.34                    24%=80.65                  42%=70.43                  100%=50   
  
7%=93.46                    25%=80.00                  43%=69.93                  110%=47.62   
  
8%=92.59                    26%=79.37                  44%=69.44                  120%=45.45   
  
9%=91.74                    27%=78.74                  45%=68.97                  130%=43.48   
  
10%=90.91                  28%=78.13                  46%=68.49                  140%=41.67   
  
11%=90.09                  29%=77.52                  47%=68.03                  150%=40   
  
12%=89.29                  30%=76.92                  48%=67.57                  160%=38.46   
  
13%=88.50                  31%=76.34                  49%=67.11                  170%=37.04   
  
14%=87.72                  32%=75.76                  50%=66.67                  180%=35.71   
  
15%=86.96                  33%=75.19                  55%=64.52                  190%=34.48   
  
16%=86.21                  34%=74.63                  60%=62.50                  200%=33.33   
  
17%=85.47                  35%=74.07                  65%=60.61   
  
18%=84.75                  36%=73.53                  70%=58.82     
  
The following formula is used to find the List Price: List Price = Cost / Multiplier x 100 x Unit.     
  
For example, if cost is 1.50, and multiplier is 60, and unit is 12, then the list price per dozen would be 30.00. (1.50 / 60 =.025 x 100 = 2.5 x 12 = 30)     
  
If you want the list price to be a fixed amount over cost, enter the amount here, followed by F.     
  
For example, 5F means that the list price will be $5.00 more than Cost plus Freight and Adjustments. This fixed multiplier works differently from a percentage multiplier. With a fixed multiplier, the List updates immediately whenever you enter the Cost or the Multiplier. Unlike a percentage multiplier, a fixed multiplier does not work with **Alt+K**, **Alt+L**, or Report# 2-10, INVENTORY PRICE UPDATE.     
  
When setting up a sales tax item, the Multiplier can be used to select the method of rounding sales tax. For more information, see "Sales Tax Setup and Usage."    
  
#### List Price (I.6)     
  
Enter the list price (selling price) in dollars and cents for the unit quantity of this item. This means the price per each, per dozen, case, hundred, etc.     
  
This field, as well as Cost, Date List Changed, and Date Cost Changed, may be updated automatically, based on Bill Entry records, by Report # 2-10, INVENTORY PRICE UPDATE.     
  
#### Date List Price Changed (I.7)     
  
Enter the date the List Price was last changed. (This field is updated automatically when you run Report # 2-10, INVENTORY PRICE UPDATE, to update the List Prices.)    
  
#### Cost (I.8)     
  
Enter the cost of each item. This is a floating point field which may have up to six decimal places. Notice that Cost is the book price per each, whereas List Price is based on the Unit. For example, if you sell the item by the hundred, enter C in Unit, enter the sell price per hundred in the List field, and enter the purchase price per each in the Cost field.     
  
If you buy the item by the case, enter the cost each, not the case price, in Cost. Enter the number per case in Buy Quantity/Case.     
  
EXCEPTION: The Ton units (T or O) is designed to be used with cost per ton, not per pound, in the Cost field.     
  
#### Date Cost Changed (I.9)     
  
Enter the date the Cost was last changed. This field is updated automatically whenever you run Report # 2-10, INVENTORY PRICE UPDATE.    
  
#### Vendor (I.10)     
  
If you are using Accounts Payable, enter the code of the vendor from whom you normally buy this item. Certain inventory reports print this code, and some can be sorted by it. It is also used when generating automatic purchase orders with Report # 1-11, INVENTORY ORDER ADVISORY.    
  
#### Print Code (I.11)     
  
A "ditto dat" field. A lookup appears for this field, revealing a list of all codes you have entered in this field in the past.    
  
This field can be used to sort the Inventory screen in special ways, using Report # 1-1, INVENTORY LISTING. For example, you could use Print Code A for a select group of your inventory. Then when you run Report # 1-1, you could press P, to sort by print code. Choosing print code A would give you a list of only the A items.     
  
Report# 1-14, INVENTORY PRICE LIST BY PRINT CODE, can be run for a certain print code or for all print codes.     
  
You can also use Print Code to make subtotals appear on Report # 1-7, INVENTORY VALUE. For each subtotal you want, bring up the last item # in the section to be subtotaled, and enter a T in the Print Code.     
  
#### Maximum (I.12)     
  
Enter the maximum quantity you wish to have on hand. This field determines suggested order quantities on Report # 1-11, INVENTORY ORDER ADVISORY.     
  
Periods may be set up to accommodate seasonal items by entering more than one maximum, separated by commas. These periods can be for any length of time you choose. Report # 1-11, INVENTORY ORDER ADVISORY will ask which period number to use. The period number indicates which maximum to use, counting from left to right. If the indicated maximum is blank, or if no period number is specified, the system defaults to the maximum for Period 1.     
  
#### Minimum (I.13)     
  
Enter the minimum stock quantity you wish to have on hand. Report # 1-11, INVENTORY ORDER ADVISORY, will suggest reordering the item when stock quantity falls below this amount. Periods may be set up to accommodate seasonal items by entering more than one minimum, separated by commas. These periods can be for any length of time you choose. They should correspond to the time periods set up in the Maximum field.     
  
An **N** entered here prevents the INVENTORY ORDER ADVISORY from suggesting an order for this item, and disables out-of-stock error messages on the Receivable Invoice (R) screen for this item. Use this feature for items that are never stocked, such as discounts or delivery charges. The N may be followed by other characters, as in N20, without affecting its function.     
  
An **I** entered here means that this is an Inactive item. This item will not show up on most inventory reports nor on the Lookup (**F6**) screen.     
  
An **O** entered here, for an Obsolete item, prevents the INVENTORY ORDER ADVISORY from suggesting an order for this item, and removes it from the F6 lookup screen when available stock is zero.    
  
An **S** is used for special order and removes the item from lookup when the available stock is zero.    
  
A **C** (Changed) will be entered on an old item when a new item number is entered and the option selected to move Min/Max to the new item.    
  
#### Discount Setup (I.14#### -17)     
  
A "ditto dat" field. A lookup appears for this field, revealing a list of all codes you have entered in this field in the past.    
  
If you enter a number here, it is recognized as a percent and deducted from the List Price.  
  
 Example: 10              Customer receives a 10% discount off List Price.     
  
Enter a number followed by L to give a fixed dollar discount off the List Price.   
  
Example: 1.25L          Customer receives $1.25 off List Price.     
  
To calculate prices as a certain percent over Cost, create discount level E by entering an E in any one of these fields followed by a number.   
  
Example: E20             Prices will be calculated as 20% over Cost.     
  
To calculate a certain percent of margin in the price, enter E followed by the margin %, followed by M.  
  
Example: E20M         If the cost is $1.00, the price will be $1.25, giving a 20% margin.    
  
You can also enter special prices in these fields. Follow a special price by a dollar sign ($).   
  
Example: If you wish to sell this item for $5.00 enter 5.00$.     
  
In the event of a string of discounts, just keep typing. The field will scroll and allow you to enter quite a lot here. To view it later, click on the little curved arrow icon. A box opens up for viewing whatever was entered here in its entirety.    
  
**DISCOUNTS A-D**-allow the calculation of four different prices per inventory item. The entry (A, B, C, or D) in the Discount Level field on the Customer (C) screen specifies which discount that customer gets when invoiced. If no Discount Level is specified, Discount A will be used.     
  
**Discount E**-can also be used to fix prices a certain amount over Cost. To do this, enter E followed by the amount with an F following the amount.     
  
For example, E10F means that the price will be $10.00 over cost.     
  
**QUANTITY DISCOUNTS**     
  
Example: 3,5*10,100*20,500*25/500,1000*30/M     
  
The number to the left of the asterisk (*) (in this case read *at*) is the start quantity for the discount, and the number to the right of the * is the discount. A comma divides the discounts. In the above example, a quantity of 0 to 4 receives 3% discount, 5 to 99 receives a 10% discount,100 to 499 a 20% discount, etc. The quantity refers to the absolute value (the total number of pieces, such as 12 in a dozen or 50 in a case) of the Order Quantity or the Ship Quantity, whichever is greater. Characters or numbers after a / specify the unit upon which the Sell Price is based and are put into Unit on the invoice. The last two discounts of the example mean that a quantity of 500 to 999 receives a 25% discount priced per 500, and 1000 or more a 30% discount priced per M (1000).     
  
Other options after the forward slash (/) are:     
  
**C**-priced per 100  
  
**G**-priced per 100 gallons  
  
**M**-priced per 1000   
  
**T**-priced per 2000 (Ton)     
  
You may combine a number and a letter.     
  
Example: 5M means priced per 5000.     
  
If the first item in a string is a quantity, it must begin with a comma (,). You do not need to begin with a comma when you begin with a discount. For example: 10,100*12 may be used instead of ,0*10,100*12. (This means 10% off for quantities under 100, and 12% off for 100 and up.)     
  
Special quantity pricing may be entered here as well.     
  
Example: ,12*.60$/12,50*2.90$/C.     
  
This means a quantity of 0 to 11 will be sold at regular price, a quantity of 12 to 49 will be priced at $.60 per twelve, and a quantity of 50 and up will be priced at $2.90 per C (100). A dollar sign ($) behind the number indicates it is a price instead of a discount.     
  
#### Group Code (I.18)     
  
A "ditto dat" field. A lookup appears for this field, revealing a list of all codes you have entered in this field in the past.    
  
The Group Code field is used for quoted group pricing of Inventory items. This allows you to discount a certain group of items to a customer rather than entering a separate quoted price for each item you wish to discount to a certain customer. Use only a SINGLE letter or number for the Group Code. Put the same letter or number in the Group Code field of each Inventory item in the group.     
  
Inventory can be sorted by this code, using Report # 1-1, INVENTORY LISTING. Select 1 to sort by Group Code.     
  
#### Location (I.19)     
  
A "ditto dat" field. A lookup appears for this field, revealing a list of all codes you have entered in this field in the past.    
  
Specify the physical location of the item.     
  
Inventory can be sorted by this code, using Report # 1-1, INVENTORY LISTING. When you select this report, you will be prompted with various options for sorting the listing. Press **L** for **L**ocation.     
  
You can also use Location to put the items in the order you want for taking physical inventory. Use Report # 1-35, PHYSICAL INVENTORY LISTING, and sort by location. When you enter the count quantities into the computer, using the Inventory Stock Adjustments (=) screen, select L to load items automatically by Location.     
  
You can page through your Inventory records by Location, using **F7** and **F8** with the cursor on this field.     
  
#### Price Update Code (I.20)    
  
A "ditto dat" field. A lookup appears for this field, revealing a list of all codes you have entered in this field in the past.    
  
The update code determines how prices for this item will be updated by Report # 2-10, INVENTORY PRICE UPDATE. Alternatively, you can select certain features of bill entry and not use the line in calculating discounts.     
  
The update code is found on the Company Setup (#), Inventory (I), Bill Entry (B) and Purchase Order (O) screens. It is automatically set on the Bill Entry and Purchase Order screens from the Inventory screen. If there is none on the Inventory screen, it comes from the Company Setup screen, but may be changed manually.     
  
Here are some possible entries:     
  
**A**-Always update the cost (book price) and the list price.   
  
**B**-Update the cost if it increased.   
  
**D**-Always update the cost.   
  
**I**-Always update the cost. Update the list price if it increased.   
  
**L**-Update the cost if it increased. Update the list if it increased.   
  
**N**-No price update.   
  
**F**-Freight or Other Adjustment items (sales tax & discount).   
  
**G**-G/L Distributions. See section titled "[G/L Distributions](#BKMKIDistributions)" later in this chapter.  
  
**O**-Omit Purchase Order posting. (Don't post this item to purchase order)   
  
**P**-Bring up List price instead of Cost when entering item on Bill.   
  
**S**-Skip Quantity & Price and go to Amount.   
  
**Q**-Stock Quantity and pricing are not changed by Unit when purchasing. This is generally used when a number followed by # is used in Unit.   
  
Q must be the LAST letter used in the Update Code field.  
  
**X**- e**X**clude purchase from Inventory Value Report (Report #1-7).    
  
**$**-Do not apply cash discount to this item. Use this with items that are not discounted, such as sales tax and freight. This code may be combined with another function; example: F$.     
  
#### Additional Description (I.21)     
  
Enter any additional description you want for this item. This additional description appears on the printed receivable orders and invoices. It does not show up on the computer screen when you enter an invoice.     
  
#### Remark (I.22)     
  
Enter any information you wish to keep in reference to this item.     
  
This field is also used to generate inventory descriptions. See the section titled "[Computer Generated Descriptions](#BKMKIDescriptions)" for more help.    
  
When a **G** is entered in the Update field, the Remark field is used to specify the distribution percent and the Account # for automatically dividing an account to multiple accounts. See "[G/L ](#BKMKIDistributions)" above.    
  
#### P/O Message (I.23)     
  
Enter any special message in relation to this item the way you want it to appear on purchase orders.     
  
#### Labor Category (I.24)     
  
*ABC JOB COSTING MODULE*-Enter the Labor Category if this is a labor item, which means you want to use it on the Time Card (T) screen. The code you enter here must be set up on the Category (K) screen. (See help for that screen.)     
  
If this field is blank, the item will be seen as material rather than labor.     
  
Note that any documentation referring to the Job Costing Module (Material, Job, or Job Detail screens) does not apply to most users. It is a custom feature.    
  
#### Job Class (I.25)     
  
*ABC JOB COSTING MODULE*-You may enter a code here to specify which job class this item is in. This code must be set up on the Job Class ('J) screen. It will automatically carry across to job transactions such as bills and material entries.     
  
If this item is not a job cost item, but you want to enter it on bills along with items that are job cost items, enter a dash (-) here. When you enter this item on a bill, it will not be included in the cost posted to the job. This may be used for such items as freight, tax, or discounts.     
  
#### MSR-Manufacturer's Suggested Retail (I.26)     
  
The MSR field stores the Manufacturer's Suggested Retail. It is loaded with parts and image importing. WRLISTPRICE uses it to calculate list price.     
  
#### Freight & Other Adjustments (I.27)     
  
This is a per-each cost, such as freight, that is in addition to the Cost. It is automatically updated from the Bill Entry screen when Report # 2-10, INVENTORY PRICE UPDATE, is run. You may enter information manually.     
  
See the section in the Bill Entry screen helps, also titled ["Freight & Other Adjustments."](../../man066.htm#B29)    
  
#### Buy Quantity/Case (I.28)     
  
If you buy this item in cases, but sell it by the piece, enter the quantity per case here. When you enter the item on a bill or purchase order, the case price will come up instead of the each price, and you can enter the number of cases instead of the unit quantity. When the bill or purchase order is posted to the item, the computer will calculate the unit quantity to post to fields such as Stock Qty and Vendor Order Qty. Also, if you run Report # 2-10, INVENTORY PRICE UPDATE, the program calculates the cost per each to update the Cost field.     
  
#### Restriction (I.29)     
  
If this field is blank, all customers will have access to this item.     
  
A single character entered in this field requires a customer to have this letter in the Customer Type field of his record before he is allowed to buy this item.     
  
Customer Types are initially set up on the Y screen. The Customer Type field of the C screen must also be filled in before the Restriction field on this screen will be useful.     
  
If the Privilege Code on the Y screen of Customer Type A matches the Restriction code on the Inventory screen, that item can be invoiced to any customer whose type is A.     
  
If you try to load the same item on an invoice for a customer who is not type A, an error message will remind you, "*Item is restricted for the customer*."     
  
#### Quantity Per Label (I.30)     
  
This field is used with Report # 3-7, SHIPPING LABELS FROM ORDERS, to determine the number of shipping labels to print. The quantity ordered, divided by this field, is added together for each line on the order to give the number of packages needed to ship the order. A label is printed for each package.     
  
This field can also be used with Report # 2-26, A/P INVENTORY LABELS. In this case, Qty Per Label determines how many labels will be printed for items on a bill entry. For example, if you store the item in boxes of 10, you would enter 10 in Qty Per Label to generate a label for each box.     
  
#### Core/Revision (I.31)     
  
This field has two different uses, both affecting Customer Invoices and Orders. You can use it for automatic deposit/core charges or revision tracking and auto ordering. See the sections following titled "Core Charges-Setup" and "Revision Maintenance and Auto Ordering" for an explanation.     
  
#### Core Charges#### -Setup (I.31)     
  
Use the core charge option for items you sell that often have an additional charge associated with them.     
  
For example, suppose you sell stoves, and you charge extra for installation, which is optional. In this example, you would set up separate items for the stove and the installation charge.     
  
On the Inventory (I) screen, bring up the stove item and enter an asterisk (*) in the Core/Deposit field. Move to the Code field (below the Activity Location field) and enter the item # for the corresponding installation charge. Save the item.     
  
Now whenever you enter the stove item on an order or invoice, you will be asked if you want a core charge. If you press **Y** for yes, the item number for installation charges will automatically be added below the stove item. A number entered in the Activity Location field skips the question and multiplies quantity for deposits.     
  
#### Revision Maintenance and Auto-Ordering (I.31)     
  
Revision Maintenance is used to track which revision a customer has of a certain item. This information can be used to automatically order the latest revision of that item when the customer orders a corresponding item.     
  
For example, suppose you sell educational materials. When a customer orders a textbook, you want him to receive the latest revision of the corresponding answer key, if he hasn't already. To set this up, follow these steps.     
  
1. Bring up the answer key item on the Inventory (I) screen. In the Core/Deposit field enter the revision number of the answer key. This may be any one-digit number, letter, or symbol other than an asterisk (*).     
  
2. Enter the Activity Location number, which may be anything from A1 to T255. (See section titled "Activity Location" below). Save the item.     
  
3. Bring up the textbook item. In the code field below Activity Location, enter the item # for the answer key. Save the item.     
  
4. Now whenever a customer orders the textbook, the software checks which version of the answer key the customer has. If he does not have the latest, you will be prompted to consider the option of adding it to the order. (This works only on orders, not on invoices).     
  
#### Activity Location (I.32)     
  
This is used with Revision Maintenance and Auto-ordering. Your ABC Accounting software can maintain revisions on up to 5100 items on a per-customer basis. To do this, it uses a revision cross-reference screen. This screen consists of a matrix with rows lettered from A to T, and columns from 1 to 255. To track revisions for a certain item, you need to assign it a position in this matrix. This position may be anything from A1 to T255. This is called the Activity Location.     
  
To view the revision matrix, use the Activity Grid ('x) screen. This screen shows only the first 78 columns, and has the delete and save functions disabled.     
  
#### Code (I.33)     
  
This field has two different uses, both affecting Customer Invoices and Orders. You can use it for automatic core charges or revision tracking and auto-ordering. See the sections titled "Core Charges-Setup" and "Revision Maintenance and Auto Ordering" for an explanation.     
  
#### Commission (I.34)     
  
A "ditto dat" field. A lookup appears for this field, revealing a list of all codes you have entered in this field in the past.    
  
Use a letter from A to L to specify what rate of commission the salesman gets for selling this item. These codes must be set up on the Salesman (S) screen. Commissions are calculated by Report # 3-42, CALCULATE SALESMAN COMMISSION.     
  
#### Comment (I.35)     
  
This is an information field for your convenience.     
  
In the event of a long comment, just keep typing. The field will scroll and allow you to enter quite a lot here. To view it later, click on the little curved arrow icon. A box opens up for viewing whatever was entered here in its entirety.    
  
#### Stock (I.38)     
  
This is an information field, sometimes used with special programming.     
  
#### Buy Description (I.39)     
  
Enter the description you want to appear on Purchase Orders for this item. If you don't want any additional description, leave this field blank. The Description field will be used for descriptions on Purchase Orders.     
  
#### Item No. and Vendor (I.40)     
  
Three fields are provided: Item # and Vendor 1, 2, and 3. This is in case you have several different major suppliers for this item.     
  
Enter the vendor's item # first; then a space, and then the vendor code as set up on the Vendor (V) screen.     
  
You can index all the items that have a particular vendor by using the **Shift+F7** and **Shift+F8** keys when your cursor is on this field.     
  
When entering a purchase order for this item, you may press **Alt+G** to load one of the alternate vendors for the item.     
  
#### UPC (I.43)     
  
Use this field to enter an item number for the product.    
  
#### New Item No. (I.44)     
  
Use this field when the item # for an item changes. For example, use it when a supplier changes his parts numbers. To use this feature, follow these steps:     
  
1. Bring up the old item, go to the New Item # field, and enter the new item # there.    
  
2. A message will appear, saying, *"New Item # 'xxxx' not found. Copy existing info to New #?"*    
  
3. Answer with a **Y** if you want the new item # to be created with the same information as the current one. (You can always make minimal changes on the new record later if you want.)    
  
4. A second message asks, *"M)ove min-max, customer orders, and open P/Os to New Item?"*    
  
5. Answer with a **Y** if you want to transfer ALL this information to the new item #.  (This does not include transfer of stock quantities. If you want to transfer stock quantities to the new item, call your ABC Accounting representative and ask for the utility "WUTISUPERSEDE" which will move data from the superseded item to the new item.)    
  
6. Now when you enter invoices or bills, and you are really used to entering the old item number and can't remember the new one, you're safe. Either item # will bring up the information for the new item # entered. However, if the old item still has a Stock Quantity listed, you will be asked if you want to use the old item or the new one.     
  
You can page through your inventory records by New Item #, using **Shift+F7** and **Shift+F8** with the cursor on this field.     
  
Note: An item which has been replaced by a new item number will have **C** (**C**hanged) in Minimum.    
  
Note: An item referenced by a New Item # may in turn reference another New Item #, up to 20 levels deep. When you enter one of the old item numbers on a bill or invoice, the program starts with that item and goes through the chain in the direction of newer items. If any of the old items are in stock, you will be given the option to select the old or new item in each case. Circular references will trigger an error and terminate at the maximum number of levels.     
  
#### Weight (I.45)     
  
Enter the weight of the item in pounds per each. (You may use hundredths of a pound.)     
  
This is used in calculating the total weight on Purchase Orders.     
  
In some customized versions, Weight is used to calculate discounts or freight charges on Invoices.     
  
*ABC SCHEDULING MODULE*-Enter daily load capacity for this item.     
  
*BARCODE MODULE* (V12)-Enter W followed by Tare Weight. When an item is entered with a W and has a scales attached, the computer requests a weight from the scales to enter in the quantity field, less the tare for that item.     
  
#### Track Serial No. (I.46)     
  
Enter a Y here if you wish to track serial numbers on this item.     
  
When you enter a bill, you will be asked to enter the serial numbers for each item you are tracking. This automatically puts those serial numbers on stock. Then when you enter an invoice, you will be asked to enter the serial numbers for the items you sold. Those serial numbers will then be taken out of stock, so that you cannot sell the same serial number twice. You will be alerted with a message if you enter the serial number incorrectly.     
  
These serial numbers will be printed on various reports, such as Report # 1-5, INVENTORY PURCHASE HISTORY, and Report # 1-19, INVENTORY SALES HISTORY.     
  
You may quit tracking serial numbers on a certain item at any time by typing an N in this field, and saving it.     
  
If the field is blank, it will be treated like an N.     
  
Serial # tracking is not allowed on an item that contains a forward slash (/) in the item code.     
  
Optional uses for the Serial # field are as follows:     
  
**L** is used for **L**ot and posts total quantity to S/N screen.  
  
**B** is used for **B**ulk and allows information but won't post to S/N.  
  
**C** is used for **C**onsignment.    
  
#### Discount-Special (I.48)     
  
A "ditto dat" field. A lookup appears for this field, revealing a list of all codes you have entered in this field in the past.    
  
This field is used for short-term, special discounts.     
  
This discount overrides all other discounts, unless another discount is greater than that listed here.     
  
See the section in your manual titled "Discount Setup" for help on how to enter discounts.    
  
In the event of a long string of discounts, just keep typing. The field will scroll and allow you to enter quite a lot here. To view it later, click on the little curved arrow icon. A box opens up for viewing whatever was entered here in its entirety.    
  
If you wish to enter a special discount on multiple, consecutive items, follow these steps.     
  
1. Go to the Special Discount field of the first item you want this special discount for.    
  
2. Press Alt+4 to activate a macro for setting this discount.    
  
3. In the first message box, enter the item code for the last item this special discount will affect. (Discount will be applied to ALL items, starting at the record you are currently viewing and ending with the item code you enter here.)    
  
4. In the second message box, enter the discount you wish to enact on these records. (See discount setup options for the A-D Discount fields.)    
  
5. The discount is automatically entered for you in all these consecutive records.    
  
#### Lead Time for P/O (I.49)     
  
This is an information field. Enter the time (in days) that it takes from ordering to receiving from your vendor.     
  
#### Order Multiplier (I.65)     
  
For items that you sell individually but must purchase by specific larger quantities, you may enter a number here to multiply your order by. So if you purchase paper towels in quantities of 24 but always sell it individually, you should enter the number 24 in this field. (*This only applies when the Vendor sells an item by individual price but ships by the case.) Then when you run Report 1-11, Inventory Order Advisory, you will be advised to order 48 rolls of paper towels when there are customer orders for 27 rolls more than you have in stock, because you must purchase them in multiples of 24.    
  
*Notice that when you purchase based on case price, you should use the Buy/Quantity field rather than the Order Multiplier field. This triggers the Order Advisory to order 2 cases of 48 rolls of paper towels rather than 48 rolls of paper towels.    
  
#### Use Tax (I)     
  
To track items that need to have [Use Tax](#G10) paid on them, set up Use Tax in the Inventory screen. For example, you could use the code PAU for PA Use Tax. Put a % in the Unit field. Put the tax rate in the List Price field. Put a U in the Tax field.     
  
The items to be tracked for Use Tax must be listed on separate Customer Invoices. (No other items but Use Tax items should be on the invoice). Use the Use Tax Code, (for example PAU) in the Tax field (located beside the Terms field) on the invoice.     
  
The Use Tax is NOT added to the invoice.     
  
To see the total cost of Use Tax items, run Report # 3-5, MULTI-CODE SALES TAX. Note that the report lists the total COST of the Use Tax items but does not calculate the Use Tax.     
  
#### Tracking Used Equipment (I)     
  
To track costs, inventory quantities and inventory value for used equipment that you repair for resale, the used equipment should be assigned distinctive inventory codes. Our standard prefix is UE- followed by an assigned number. When you use UE-, you need only press **Alt+Q** to enter a new item. The program automatically assigns the next number.     
  
Set up a Sale G/L # for used equipment. ABC's standard number is 5095.     
  
If the used equipment is traded in, list it on the invoice when you sell the new equipment, using the assigned inventory code with a -1 in Quantity. This puts the item into inventory. Sell price should be the credit amount that you are allowing for the used equipment. Your cost can be found by pressing **Alt+S** on the I screen. Enter the cost in the Cost field on the I screen.     
  
If you are not tracking the trade-in of the equipment, bring it into inventory by putting it on an adjustment bill on the Bill Entry screen, using a positive 1. Your cost can be found by pressing #### Alt+B on the Inventory screen. Enter your cost in the Cost field on the Inventory screen.     
  
When you begin repairing the equipment, track the parts used and labor on a customer order. Put yourself as the customer on the order. On the first line of the order, put the used equipment code with nothing in quantity.     
  
When the repairs are done, invoice the order to yourself. Discount the invoice 100% using the used equipment Sale G/L #. Add the order total to the trade-in cost that you had entered in the Cost field on the Inventory screen.     
  
#### How to Set Up Inventory Items (I)     
  
To go to the Inventory screen, press **F10** and then **I**.     
  
1. The first field is Item #. Type in the item # you want to use for the Item. (You may use letters, numbers or other symbols.) If there is an item # already in the field, press **Ctrl+N** to open a New record. Then enter your item number. If you are entering many Inventory items, you may save time by setting up inventory default records. To learn more about this, see the section on Default Records.    
  
2. Type in the desired description and press **Enter**. For more help, see the section on setting up computer-generated descriptions.    
  
3. Press #### Enter to go to the fields you want to fill in such as Unit, List price and Cost. Fill in the desired information.     
  
4. Press the #### F9 key to save the Inventory item.     
  
5. If you do not have a Sale G/L number entered, an error message says, *"G/L # must be specified."* Press #### Enter to acknowledge the message, and you are taken to the Sale G/L field. Enter the General Ledger number that has been set up for sales of this inventory item. Press the #### F9 key again to save the Inventory item.     
  
#### Default Record Setup (I)    
  
A Default record is a record that contains all the most commonly used information for your inventory records. Setting up a default record saves the operator from entering the same information again and again.     
  
Here are the basic steps for setting up a default inventory item record.    
  
1. Enter a quote (") in the Item # field.   
  
2. Enter any information that common to a majority of the items you enter. This could be G/L #, Update Code, Multiplier and Tax Code for Inventory items.   
  
3. Save the record with **F9**.  
  
4. If you want to make changes to your default record, go back into it, make the changes, and save again.     
  
When you enter a new Inventory item, the information that you entered in the Default record will be displayed. Then you enter whatever other information you want on that record. Change any default information that does not apply to this item.    
  
For example, if you have a number of inventory items to enter with similar descriptions and the same cost or list price, you could enter this information on the Inventory Default (") record. Then enter the inventory items, using a different code for each one. AT LEAST one change has to be made on a record, or it cannot be saved as a unique record.     
  
An example of how to use a default record follows.     
  
Let's say you have a lot of inventory items to enter with the same price and general ledger number. Fill in those fields on the default record, and they will automatically default to any new inventory item record you create.     
  
The Inventory screen can have default records with partial item numbers. For example, use "AB as an item #. Now any new item # you enter beginning with AB will automatically load the information entered on the "AB record. You may override this information at any time on any of the records you are creating.     
  
#### Paying Bills by Serial Number (I)     
  
1. The item must be set up on the Inventory (I) screen with a Y in the Track Serial # field, close to the bottom right-hand corner of the screen.     
  
2. When the item is entered on the Bill Entry (B) screen, a unique serial # needs to be assigned to each one purchased.     
  
3. The Terms for the Bill must have a Y in the Pay by S/N field.     
  
4. On the Check Writing (/) screen, choose Option 1. Press **Alt+T** twice. Once to display individual bills and again to display the individual serial # items on bills that are marked to be paid by Serial #. The cost of serial # items that have been sold, but not paid for, will display in the Due Column.     
  
5. To select all serial # items on Customer invoices and all due bills for payment, press + on the top line of the Check Writing screen. To select ALL serial # items, invoiced or not, and all open bills, press * on the top line. To select by vendor, press + or * on the line that has the vendor's name. To select by Bill, press + or * on the line that has the bill number. To select individual serial # items, press + or * on the item line.     
  
6. When you are finished with your selections, press **F5** and then choose Option 3 to generate the check(s).     
  
#### G/L Distributions (I)    
  
An item can be set up so that when it is used on a bill entry, the amount is automatically distributed to multiple G/L accounts. To set up such an item, enter a G in the Update field, and use Remark to specify the distribution percents and account numbers. Enter the percentage; then the percent sign (%) and G/L account number. Use a comma (,) to separate additional distributions.     
  
Example: 20%1580,30%2580 would divide the entered amount 20% to account 1580 and 30% to account 2580, leaving the remaining 50% where the amount was entered.     
  
This is used for payments, such as electric bills, that you want to split between several businesses or persons.     
  
#### Inventory Posted Fields (I)     
  
The following fields are restricted and are maintained in the background by the software: Post Date, Month-to-date Buy Amount, Prior Buy Amount, Month-to-date Sell Amount, Prior Sell Amount, Month-to-date Sell Cost, Month-to-date Buy Quantity, Prior Buy Quantity, Month-to-date Sell Quantity, Prior Sell Quantity, Month-to-date Sample Quantity, Prior Sample Quantity, Sample Quantity 1 Year Ago, Sample Quantity 2 Years Ago, Sell Quantity 1 Year Ago and Sell Quantity 2 Years Ago.     
  
These fields are updated upon entry of a Customer Invoice or a Bill. The Post Date tells when the last transaction was posted, and indicates which month is represented in the month-to-date figures.     
  
#### Inventory Rebate Tracking (I)     
  
The Inventory (I) screen has accommodations for tracking rebates given to customers after they purchased a rebate item.     
  
The tracking of rebates ties in with the tracking of serial numbers; therefore, you must track serial numbers on all items on which you want to give rebates.     
  
1. Set up any item that has a rebate offer with it on the Inventory (I) screen. Make sure you put a **Y** in the Track Serial # field.     
  
2. Set up a separate record in the Inventory (I) screen for the rebate offer.     
  
a. The Item Code must be the same as the Item Code of the item itself with a dollar sign ($) attached. (If you have multiple rebate offers, an asterisk (*) or ampersand (&) may also be used here.)     
  
b. The Item Description should also specify that this is a rebate offer.     
  
c. You may enter the amount of the rebate offer in the List Price field as a negative figure.     
  
d. Once again, use a #### Y in the Track Serial # field.     
  
3. When you enter an invoice for a rebate item, you will need to enter the serial number as well.     
  
The program automatically takes this serial number out of stock, so that you cannot invoice the same serial number twice.     
  
4. To give the rebate to the customer, you must enter the rebate offer code on the Receivable Invoice (R) screen. This may be done on the original invoice AFTER the invoice has been saved, or it may be entered on a separate invoice if the rebate is sent in after the original purchase.     
  
a. Enter the Quantity as a positive figure.     
  
b. Enter the serial number of the item for which the rebate is being given. If a rebate was given for this specific serial number before you will not be allowed to give more another rebate for the item.     
  
c. Enter the Amount as a negative figure.    
  
The status and location of items with serial numbers may be viewed on the Inventory Serial # ('F) screen.     
  
#### Generating a Series of Inventory Codes (I)     
  
Sometimes you may have inventory codes to set up that begin the same and have a set of letters or numbers at the end to make them distinctive. For example, using the code PNRP (for Pens, Ritepoint) and adding the suffixes, WHT, BRN, BLK, GRN, YEL, GRY, ORG, BLU and RED to indicate the available colors. After the color code you want the suffixes RG, FN, TH, XF, XT to indicate the type of point available.     
  
1. Enter the Item code PNRP. Enter the description PENS, RITEPOINT. Enter any information that will be the same for all the items you are generating codes for.     
  
2. Press **Alt+G**. Enter the 1st suffixes, separated by commas:   
  
WHT,BRN,BLK,GRN,YEL,GRY,ORG,BLU,RED     
  
3. Enter the 2nd suffixes separated by commas:   
  
RG,FN,TH,XF,XT     
  
4. Type Y twice to confirm the first and second suffixes.     
  
5. The software generates 45 codes and descriptions, beginning with PNRPBLKFN and ending with PNRPYELXT. Any information entered with the original code in step # 1, such as G/L # and List Price will also be in each of the 45 records.
