Whenever you enter the city and state for a new zip code anywhere in the system, that zip code, city, and state, are added to the zip code files kept here in the Zip Code (Z) screen. Once the city and state have been entered, the only way to change them is by going directly into the Zip Code (Z) screen.     
  
NOTE: Changing the information on this screen will change ALL addresses on ALL records containing this zip code!       
  
### Helps Accessed from the Zip Code (Z) Screen

#### Edit Help (Z)     
  
**Ctrl+C**-**C**opies text. Place your cursor on the field that contains the text you wish to copy and press **Ctrl+C**. Then move your cursor to the field you want your information copied to and use the paste (**Ctrl+V**) function.     
  
**Ctrl+V**-pastes text. Any text that has been copied (with **Ctrl+C**) or cut (with **Ctrl+X**) may be pasted into any other field by using the **Ctrl+V** function. Simply place your cursor in the field you want to copy the information to and press **Ctrl+V**.     
  
**Ctrl+X**-cuts text. Place your cursor on the field you want the text removed from and press **Ctrl+X**. The text will disappear. If you want to replace this text in another field, simply move your cursor to that field and use the paste (**Ctrl+V**) function.     
  
**Ctrl+Z**-**Z**ap! Undoes latest changes to the line the cursor is on.       
  
#### Tools Help (Z)     
  
**Ctrl+G**-**G**ets or jumps to the address of a certain field. When you press **Ctrl+G,** a message box appears telling you the address of the field your cursor is on. You are also given opportunity to jump to another address. Enter the location number of the field you want to jump to, or enter F and the field number of the field you want to jump to.     
  
**Ctrl+J**-accesses a **J**ournal to record anything that you want to remember about this zip code. To see previous notes, press **Ctrl+J**. When you are done, press **F9**. The notes will be saved with the date and time.     
  
**Ctrl+K**-accesses a second journal. It is similar to the **Ctrl+J** journal, but saves your notes with only the date.     
  
**Ctrl+W**-puts the currently loaded Zip code on a **W**ord Processor list. To see the list, press **F10, W, Ctrl+N** (to clear screen) and then type ZLIST. [Ctrl+W](#BKMKC042W)    
  
**Shift+F3**-brings up an accountant's* calculator when your press it the first time. The second time you press it, the final calculations showing are entered into the field the cursor was on.    
  
 + adds or totals                 - subtracts                / divides   
  
 * multiplies                           ) clears                      ( exits calculator   
  
 = totals or equals     
  
*If you are not familiar with an accountant's calculator, you may want to take a little time to familiarize yourself with the differences in usage here. Figures are entered as positive or negative: i.e. 100+50-75= would be entered as 100+; 50+; 75- The answer calculates each time you press the positive or negative sign. The = sign or Enter key seldom need be used unless you are multiplying or dividing.      
  
#### Zip Code (Z.0)     
  
NOTE: Changing a zip code will affect addresses on ALL records containing that zip code. These records may be from the Customer, Employee, Names, and Vendor screens.     
  
Enter the zip code without the extension.     
  
In some cases, multiple cities share the same zip code. Use the zip code as normal for the first city. For the next city, attach a capital A to the end of the zip code to make it unique. For example, use 17538 for Landisville, PA, and use 17538A for Salunga, PA. If there are more cities sharing a zip code than there are letters in the alphabet, try AA, AB, AC . . . BA, BB, etc.    
  
For foreign addresses other than Canada, precede the zip code with an open bracket ([) and that country's two character code. (Foreign codes are listed later in this chapter.) The open-bracket indicates that this is a foreign zip code. When the address is printed, the open bracket and country initials are removed.     
  
Example: Zacatecas, Mexico 98000, your code should be [MX98000.     
  
Some foreign countries have no zip codes. If the country has no zip code, use up to six characters to make a code for each city. Begin the code with an open-bracket ([) and the two-character code for that country. Add up to three characters to make the code unique for that city. You could use the first three letters of the city name. (No zip code will print for a foreign address with less than 6 digits after the bracket. So what you create here is for indexing purposes only.)     
  
Example: [CBCAL could be used for Cali-Valle, Colombia,  South America.     
  
#### Sorting Zip Codes    
  
The Zip Code field is also used for sorting bulk mailings when you run Report # 6-10, SORTED MAILING LABELS.     
  
To sort zip codes by state, enter the first three digits of the first zip code for that state followed by the # symbol. Enter the last zip code for that state in the Section End field.     
  
To sort zip codes by section, enter the first three digits of the first zip code for that section followed by a $. Enter the last zip code for that section in the Section End field.     
  
To sort by city, enter the first five-digit zip code for that city here. Enter the last zip code for that city in the Section End field.     
  
#### Zip Codes With Shipping Module    
  
For the Zip Code screen to be compatible with the (optional) *Shipping Module*, zip codes must be set up as follows:     
  
U.S. zip codes must begin with a number from 0-9.     
  
Canadian zip codes must begin with a letter from A-Z.     
  
Zip codes starting with a bracket ([) followed by a two-digit code are for foreign addresses other than Canada.     
  
For the shipping program to calculate freight properly, the two-digit codes must be set up as detailed. The codes are shown on the following pages.

#### Entering Zip Codes in the ABC Accounting Software     
  
All addresses in the system use the Zip Code (Z) screen. When you type information in the Street Address field of any screen and press **Enter**, the cursor jumps directly to the Zip Code field.       Type in the Zip      Code. If the zip code is already recorded in the files, the city and state      automatically display when you press **Enter** on the zip code field.       If the Zip Code      was not in the records already, a Lookup box appears, allowing you to      choose an existing zip code. If the zip code you want is not there, press **Alt+A**      to add the new zip code to the zip code files.       Then return to      the screen you were entering data on and continue.
